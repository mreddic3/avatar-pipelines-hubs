## Exported GLB models

These are the finalized models that can be used within Hubs.

AvatarBot_Base.glb is the default robot avatar.
AvatarBot_Base_var1.glb is the alternate 'hourglass shaped' robot avatar.

Both models have identical UV texture layouts so creating a texture for one will generally work on the other. (However, it's subjective how good that texture looks on one or the other...)

For example, here is the same texture applied to both variants:
